Learn how to make a cryptocurrency finance price tracker app in this React API Project.

## Description
I will use React Hook and Axios for this React JS Project. I will mainly use useEffect and useState.

Will be able to search currencies and have it display on the browser. Also, the prices will update live whenever you refresh the page. I will get all of the data from a public API.
